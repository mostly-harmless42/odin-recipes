    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large or 3–4 medium waxy potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>1 Spanish onion, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>400 ml olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Intructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Thinly slice the potato halves, cut side down, so that you end up with half-circle shaped slices. Do the same with the onion.</li>
        <li>Pour the olive oil into a deep frying pan and add the thinly sliced onion. Place over a high heat so you are cooking the onion from cold. Once the onion starts to sizzle (this should take about 5 minutes), add the sliced potatoes. Cook for about 15 minutes, stirring from time to time, until they are soft and cooked throughout. The potatoes and onions should have browned in some corners because of the contact with the bottom of the pan. If this hasn’t happened drain away some of the oil and caramelize them a bit in the pan. Remove the potatoes and onions from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Break the eggs into a large bowl but don’t whisk them; check there are no pieces of shell. Add the hot potatoes and onions to the eggs and season with salt while the potatoes are sitting on the top. Carefully mix through; use a fork to break up the eggs but don’t over-mix – justcan, leave the mixture to rest for half an hour to allow the flavours to develop.</li>
        <li>To make the tortilla place a non-stick pan over a medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. When the pan is hot add the egg mixture. If you don’t have a non-stick pan add the mixture to a very hot pan but reduce the heat to its lowest setting straight away; this will stop the tortilla sticking to the pan. Do not stir the contents of the pan!</li>
    </ol>
