    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (283g) milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (43g) melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (180g) All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar or 1/4 cup (35g) malted milk powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Intructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs and milk until light and foamy, about 3 minutes at high speed of a stand or hand mixer. Stir in the butter or vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Whisk the dry ingredients together to evenly distribute the salt, baking powder and sweetener.</li>
        <li>Gently and quickly mix into the egg and milk mixture. Let the batter rest for at least 15 minutes, while the griddle is heating; it'll thicken slightly.</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy frying pan over medium heat, or set an electric griddle to 375Â°F. Lightly grease frying pan or griddle. The pan or griddle is ready if a drop of water will skitter across the surface, evaporating immediately.</li>
        <li>Drop 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the lightly greased griddle. Bake on one side until bubbles begin to form and break, about 2 minutes; then turn the pancakes and cook the other side until brown, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Turn over only once. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
